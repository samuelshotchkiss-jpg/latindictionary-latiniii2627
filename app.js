    // --- Pharr grammar links -------------------------------------------------
    // A {{tagged}} grammatical term opens the matching entry in the digital
    // Pharr appendix. The target is the GLOSSARY ENTRY, not a section number:
    // the entry carries Pharr's definition, the editor's plain-English
    // expansion, and a "Kinds" menu listing each construction with its own
    // section. A student who has forgotten what an ablative is and lands on
    // section 30 gets "the case of adverbial relation" and nothing else --
    // true, and no help at all. The entry answers the question they have.
    //
    // WHERE THE APPENDIX LIVES, and how to point at a local copy while testing.
    // This app has no build step -- the files served are the files edited -- so
    // there is no place to substitute an environment variable. Instead:
    //
    //     ...index.html?pharr=http://localhost:8766/     point at a local copy
    //     ...index.html?pharr=off                        back to the live site
    //
    // The choice is remembered afterwards, so the query string is needed once;
    // bookmark the ?pharr= link and testing is a click.
    //
    // WHY A URL PARAMETER AND NOT JUST localStorage. The base is resolved once,
    // while this script loads. Setting localStorage from the console therefore
    // does nothing until a reload -- and a tab restored from the back/forward
    // cache never re-runs the script at all, so the SAME window keeps the old
    // target while a freshly opened one behaves correctly. That is a genuinely
    // confusing failure, and it is avoided entirely by carrying the value in the
    // URL, where it is present *before* anything is resolved.
    //
    // TWO SAFETY PROPERTIES, both about failing toward the real site:
    //   * PRODUCTION IS THE DEFAULT, unconditionally. Missing value, blocked
    //     storage, a thrown exception -- every path returns the live URL.
    //   * The override is honoured ONLY when this page is itself on localhost,
    //     so neither a stale stored value nor a ?pharr= link that gets forwarded
    //     to a student can redirect anyone away from the live appendix.
